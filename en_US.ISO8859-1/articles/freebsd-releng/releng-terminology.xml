  <title>Freezing the &os; Source Tree</title>

  <para>This section describes the general procedures related to the
    <quote>code slush</quote> and <quote>code freeze</quote> during
    the &os; release cycle.</para>

  <para>This applies to both &branch.head; and &branch.stable;
    branches.</para>

  <sect2 xml:id="releng-code-slush">
    <title>The Code Slush</title>

    <para>Approximately one month prior to the scheduled <quote>code
	slush</quote>, the &team.re; sends a reminder email to the
      &os; Developers.</para>

    <para>Although the code slush is technically not a hard freeze on
      the tree, the &team.re; requests that bugs in the existing code
      base take priority over new features.</para>

    <para>The code slush does not enforce commit approvals to the
      branch.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="releng-code-freeze">
    <title>The Code Freeze</title>

    <para>Approximately one week prior to the scheduled <quote>code
	freeze</quote>, the &team.re; sends a reminder email to the
      &os; Developers.</para>

    <para>The code freeze marks the point in time where all commits to
      the branch require explicit approval from the &team.re;.</para>

    <para>The &os; <application>Subversion</application> repository
      contains several hooks to perform sanity checks before any
      commit is actually committed to the tree.  One of these hooks
      will evaluate if committing to a particular branch requires
      specific approval.</para>

    <para>To enforce commit approvals by the &team.re;, the Release
      Engineer updates
      <filename>base/svnadmin/conf/approvers</filename>, and commits
      the change back to the repository.  Once this is done, any
      change to the branch must include an <quote>Approved by:</quote>
      line in the commit message.</para>

    <para>The <quote>Approved by:</quote> line must match the second
      column in <filename>base/svnadmin/conf/approvers</filename>,
      otherwise the commit will be rejected by the repository
      hooks.</para>
