      <title>The <filename>release.sh</filename> Script</title>

      <para>Prior to &os;&nbsp;9.0-RELEASE,
	<filename>src/release/Makefile</filename> was updated to
	support &man.bsdinstall.8;, and the
	<filename>src/release/generate-release.sh</filename> script
	was introduced as a wrapper to automate invoking the
	&man.release.7; targets.</para>

      <para>Prior to &os;&nbsp;9.2-RELEASE,
	<filename>src/release/release.sh</filename> was introduced,
	which heavily based on
	<filename>src/release/generate-release.sh</filename> included
	support to specify configuration files to override various
	options and environment variables.  Support for configuration
	files provided support for cross building each architecture
	for a release by specifying a separate configuration file for
	each invocation.  See &man.release.7; and
	<filename>src/release/release.conf.sample</filename> for more
	details and example usage.</para>

    <sect3 xml:id="releng-build-scripts-multiple">
      <title>The <filename>thermite.sh</filename> Wrapper
	Script</title>

      <para>In order to make cross building the full set of
	architectures supported on a given branch faster, easier, and
	reduce human error factors, a wrapper script around
	<filename>src/release/release.sh</filename> was written to
	iterate through the various combinations of architectures and
	invoke <filename>src/release/release.sh</filename> using
	a configuration file specific to that architecture.</para>

      <para>The wrapper script is called
	<filename>thermite.sh</filename>, which is available in the
	&os; Subversion repository at
	<literal>svn://svn.freebsd.org/user/gjb/thermite/</literal>,
	in addition to configuration files used to build
	&branch.head; and &branch.stablex; development
	snapshots.</para>
