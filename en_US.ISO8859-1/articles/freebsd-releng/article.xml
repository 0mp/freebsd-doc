    <title>Introduction to the &os; Release Engineering
      Process</title>

    <para>Development of &os; has a very specific workflow.  In
      general, all changes to the &os; base system are committed to
      the <literal>head/</literal> branch, which reflects the top of
      the source tree.</para>

    <para>After a reasonable testing period, changes can then be
      merged to the <literal>stable/</literal> branches.  The default
      minimum timeframe before merging to <literal>stable/</literal>
      branches is three (3) days.</para>

    <para>Although a general rule to wait a minimum of three days
      before mergeing from <literal>head/</literal>, there are a few
      special circumstances where an immediate merge may be necessary,
      such as a critical security fix, or a bug fix that directly
      inhibits the release build process.</para>

    <para>After several months, and the number of changes in the
      <literal>stable/</literal> branch have grown significantly, it
      is time to release the next version of &os;.  These releases
      have been historically referred to as <quote>point</quote>
      releases.</para>

    <para>In between releases from the <literal>stable/</literal>
      branches, approximately every two (2) years, a release will be
      cut directly from <literal>head/</literal>.  These releases
      have been historically referred to as <quote>dot-zero</quote>
      releases.</para>

    <para>This article will highlight the workflow and
      responsibilities of the &team.re; for both
      <quote>dot-zero</quote> and <quote>point</quote>'
      releases.</para>

    <para>Approximately two months before the start of the release
      cycle, the &team.re; decides on a schedule for the release.
      The schedule includes the various milestone points of the
      release cycle, such as freeze dates, branch dates, and build
      dates.  For example:</para>
